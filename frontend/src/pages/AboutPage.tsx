                <p>
                  streamclout was created to bring transparency to the music streaming industry by providing 
                  artists, managers, and fans with access to real-time Spotify streaming data that was previously 
                  unavailable to the public.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe that creators deserve clear insights into how their music performs, and fans should be 
                  able to see the true impact of their listening habits. Our platform bridges this information gap by
                  offering accurate, daily-updated streaming metrics directly from the source.

                    The data comes from Spotify's internal API that employees and internal services use. 
                    We found a way of accessing these internal systems through legal methods and are now 
                    offering the data to the public.

                    We estimate revenue based on the total streams a song or album collected. We then multiply 
                    the total stream count by $0.004, which is an estimation for the average amount Spotify pays 
                    per stream. Keep in mind that the geography and free/paid breakdown of listeners affect the 
                    average dollar amount per stream paid out to the artist.
