                        StreamClout was created to bring transparency to the music streaming industry by providing
                        artists, managers, and fans with access to real-time <strong>Spotify streaming data</strong> that was previously
                        unavailable to the public.

                        We believe that creators deserve clear insights into how their music performs, and fans should be
                        able to see the true impact of their listening habits. Our platform bridges this information gap by
                        offering accurate, daily-updated <strong>Spotify track streams</strong> and <strong>stream count</strong> metrics directly from the source.

                    The <strong>Spotify streaming data</strong> comes from Spotify's internal API that employees and internal services use.
                    We found a way of accessing these internal systems through legal methods and are now
                    offering the real-time <strong>track stream counts</strong> to the public for transparency.

                    We estimate revenue based on the total <strong>Spotify track streams</strong> a song or album collected. We then multiply
                    the total <strong>stream count</strong> by $0.004, which is an estimation for the average amount Spotify pays
                    per stream. Keep in mind that the geography and free/paid breakdown of listeners affect the
                    average dollar amount per stream paid out to the artist.
